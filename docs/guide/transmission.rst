Transmission and Absorption of X-rays in matter
===============================================
The purpose of this guide is to present an overview of the `roentgen.absorption` module which provides for the calculation of the transmission and absorption of X-rays through and by various materials.

Mass Attenuation Coefficient
----------------------------
The primary component that mediates the x-ray attenuation through a material is its mass attenuation coefficient.
These tabulated values can be inspected using `roentgen.absorption.MassAttenuationCoefficient`.
To create one::

    from roentgen.absorption import MassAttenuationCoefficient
    si_matten = MassAttenuationCoefficient('Si')

Tabulated values for all elements are provided as well as additional specialized materials.
Elements can be specificied by their symbol name or by their full name (e.g. Si, Silicon).
A list of all of the elements is provided by::

    roentgen.elements

Specialized materials, referred to as compounds, are also available. A complete list is provided by::

    roentgen.compounds

Here is the mass attenuation coefficient for Silicon.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import astropy.units as u
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from roentgen.absorption import MassAttenuationCoefficient

    si_matten = MassAttenuationCoefficient('Si')
    plt.plot(si_matten.energy, si_matten.data)
    plt.yscale('log')
    plt.xscale('log')
    plt.xlabel('Energy [' + str(si_matten.energy[0].unit) + ']')
    plt.ylabel('Mass Attenuation Coefficient [' + str(si_matten.data[0].unit) + ']')
    plt.title(si_matten.name)

Material
--------
In order to determine the x-ray attenuation through a material the `roentgen.absorption.Material` object is provided.
This object can be created by providing the thickness of the material through which the x-rays are interacting.
The thickness must be given by a `~astropy.units.Quantity`.
For example, a 500 micron thick layer of Aluminum can be created like so::

    al = Material('Al', 500 * u.micron)

An optional density can also be provided.
A default density is assumed if none is provided.
Default values can be found in :download:`elements.csv <../../roentgen/data/elements.csv>` for elements or in :download:`compounds_mixtures.csv <../../roentgen/data/compounds_mixtures.csv>` for compounds.
To inspect the density::

    al.density

Using this object it is possible to get the absorption and transmission as a function of energy::

    energy = u.Quantity(np.arange(1,30), 'keV')
    al.transmission(energy)
    al.absoprtion(energy)

Here is a plot of the transmission of x-rays through 500 micron of Aluminum, a standard thickness for electronics boxes.
The transmission and absorption is given on a scale from 0 (no absorption or
no transmission) to 1 (complete absorption or complete transmission).

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import astropy.units as u

    from roentgen.absorption import Material

    al = Material('Al', 500 * u.micron)
    energy = u.Quantity(np.arange(1, 30, 0.2), 'keV')

    plt.plot(energy, al.transmission(energy))
    plt.ylabel('Transmission')
    plt.xlabel('Energy [' + str(energy.unit) + ']')
    plt.title(al.name)


From the above plot, one can see that the this thickness of Aluminum blocks almost all x-rays below about 7 keV.
The relationship between transmission and absorption can be seen in the following plot for 500 microns of Silicon, a standard thickness for a soft x-ray detector.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import astropy.units as u

    from roentgen.absorption import Material

    si = Material('Si', 500 * u.micron)
    energy = u.Quantity(np.arange(1, 50), 'keV')

    plt.plot(energy, si.absorption(energy), label='Absorption')
    plt.plot(energy, si.transmission(energy), label='Transmission')
    plt.xlabel('Energy [' + str(energy.unit) + ']')
    plt.title(si.name)
    plt.legend(loc='lower left')


Besides elements, a number of compounds and mixtures are also available.
As a simple example, here is the transmission of x-rays through 10 meters of air.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import astropy.units as u

    from roentgen.absorption import Material

    thickness = 10 * u.m
    air = Material('air', thickness)
    energy = u.Quantity(np.arange(1, 30, 0.2), 'keV')

    plt.plot(energy, air.transmission(energy))
    plt.ylabel('Transmission')
    plt.xlabel('Energy [' + str(energy.unit) + ']')
    plt.title(f"{thickness} {air.name}")

This plot shows that air, though not a dense material, does block low energy x-rays over long distances.
For convenience, the function `~roentgen.util.density_ideal_gas` is provided which can calculate the density of a gas given a pressure and temperature.

Stack
-----
Materials can be added together to form more complex optical paths.
If two or more materials are added together they form a `roentgen.absorption.Stack`.
A simple example is the transmission through air and then through a thermal blanket composed of a thin layer of mylar and Aluminum::

    optical_path = Material('air', 2 * u.m) + Material('mylar', 5 * u.micron) + Material('Al', 5 * u.micron)

This new object also provides transmission and absorption of the combination of these materials.
Here is a plot of that transmission over energy

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import astropy.units as u

    from roentgen.absorption import Material

    optical_path = Material('air', 2 * u.m) + Material('mylar', 5 * u.micron) + Material('Al', 5 * u.micron)
    energy = u.Quantity(np.arange(1, 30, 0.2), 'keV')

    plt.plot(energy, optical_path.transmission(energy), label='Transmission')
    plt.ylabel('Efficiency')
    plt.xlabel('Energy [' + str(energy.unit) + ']')
    plt.legend(loc='upper left')


Frequently, it is useful to consider the response function of a particular detector which includes absorption through materials in front of a detector.
This can be calculated by multiplying the transmission of the materials before the detector with the absorption of the detector material.

To simplify this process, the `roentgen.absorption.Response` class is provided.
The following example uses the same optical path as defined above and assumes a Silicon detector.

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import astropy.units as u
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from roentgen.absorption import Material, Response, Stack
    import numpy as np

    optical_path = Stack([Material('air', 2 * u.m), Material('mylar', 5 * u.micron), Material('Al', 5 * u.micron)])
    detector = Material('Si', 500 * u.micron)
    resp = Response(optical_path=optical_path, detector=detector)
    energy = u.Quantity(np.arange(1, 30, 0.2), 'keV')

    plt.plot(energy, resp.response(energy))
    plt.xlabel('Energy [' + str(energy.unit) + ']')
    plt.ylabel('Response')

This plot shows that the peak efficiency for this detector system is less than 50% and lies around 15 keV.
