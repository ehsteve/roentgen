This is a Python package for the quantitative analysis of the interaction of energetic x-rays with matter.
This package is named after one of the discoverers of X-rays, `Wilhelm Roentgen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_RÃ¶ntgen>`_.
He was awarded the very first Nobel Prize in Physics "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him".
X-rays were originally referred to as Roentgen rays.
