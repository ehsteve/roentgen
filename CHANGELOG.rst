Changelog
=========
We follow `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_ practices so versions increment as

#. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
#. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
#. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
